MGMRES is a Fortran90 library which applies the restarted Generalized Minimal
Residual (GMRES) algorithm to solve a sparse linear system, using a compressed
row format. Originally written in C++ by Lili Ju at the Mathematics Department
of the University of South Carolina, and ported to Fortran 90 by John Burkardt
at the Department of Scientific Computing at Florida State University.
